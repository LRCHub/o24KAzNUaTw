It was Friday night in Oxford, Mississippi, there's a big game tomorrow
Is there a cold beer calling anybody's name tonight, y'all?

It's been one of them clock it in, knock it out, clock it out
'Bout to kick off the weekend
There's a stretch of blacktop
I ain't never seen a cop
So, I'm pushing it a little past ten
Pulled a little money from the bank, put it in the tank
Shined up the windshield glass
Don't know where the night might lead, ain't nowhere to be
But I gotta get there fast

There's a cold beer calling my name
Feel a good time coming, got a new song humming
And the sunset's doing its thing
Feeling lucky as a seven
Yeah, sometimes, heaven
Here's a pocket full of payday green
And my baby putting sugar on me
Yeah, it's sure been a pretty damn good day
And there's a cold beer calling my name
Who's drinkin' cold beer in here tonight?

If there's a hillbilly rock show
I'll be in the front row
Holding up a red Bic flame
Or a wraparound porch with a citronella torch
Yeah, you know I'm down either way
There's a chance that tonight might be
A night that we ain't ever gonna forget
Yeah, everybody's turning it up, I got a little buzz
And I ain't even had one yet

There's a cold beer calling my name
Feel a good time coming, got a new song humming
And the sunset's doing its thing
Feeling lucky as a seven
Yeah, sometimes, heaven
There's a pocket full of payday green
And my baby putting sugar on me
Yeah, it's sure been a pretty damn good day
And there's a cold beer calling my name
It's calling my-

Yeah, I'm gonna put a little chill in my weekend
Stay up all night, maybe sleep in
I'm gonna sip a little something
I ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing, 'cause
There's a cold beer calling my name
Cold

There's a cold beer calling my name
Feel a good time coming, got a new song humming
And the sunset's doing its thing
Feeling lucky as a seven
Yeah, sometimes, heaven
There's a pocket full of payday green
And my baby putting sugar on me
Yeah, it's sure been a pretty damn good day
And there's a cold beer calling my name
It's calling my name

Cold beer calling my name
It's calling my name
Yeah
I'm gonna put a little chill in my weekend
